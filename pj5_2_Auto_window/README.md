# Project 5.2 Close the window

## Description

We wil work to use a servo and a raindrop sensor to make an device closing windows automatically when raining.

## Component Knowledge

**Raindrop Sensor:** This is an analog input module, the greater the area covered by water on the detection surface, the greater the value returned (range 0~4096).

## Test Code

[src/pj5_2_Auto_window.cpp](src/pj5_2_Auto_window.cpp)

## Test result

At first, the window opens automatically, and the you touch the raindrop sensor with yoour hand (which has water on the skin), the windoow will close.
