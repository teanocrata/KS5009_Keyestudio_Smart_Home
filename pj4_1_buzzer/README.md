# Project 4.1 Play Happy Birthday

## Test Code

[src/pj4_1_buzzer.cpp](src/pj4_1_buzzer.cpp)

The code uses an extra file, [src/pitches.h](src/) taken form [arduino docs](https://docs.arduino.cc/built-in-examples/digital/toneMelody/). This file contains all the pitch values for typical notes. For example, NOTE_C4 is middle C. NOTE_FS4 is F sharp, and so forth. This note table was originally written by Brett Hagman, on whose work the tone() command was based. You may find it useful whenever you want to make musical notes.

## Test result

The passive buzzer will play happy Birthday.
